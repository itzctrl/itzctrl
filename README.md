# Hello!

I'm Ctrl, an 18-year-old tech enthusiast currently studying Further Maths and Computer Science in the UK.

Technology has always been a fascinating topic to me, hence why I've tried my best to keep up with everything in this field.

I hope to someday work in this industry, particularly in the 'backend' part of things as I'm more of a fan of functionality over looks and, judging by this simple website, I hope that's obvious :)
